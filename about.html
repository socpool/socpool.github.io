                <ul>
                    <li>The test consists of a 25 yard swim (without touching the wall) and 1 minute treading water in
                        the deep end.</li>
                    <li>Tests will take place at rest periods or anytime a guard is free. Swim team members may be
                        tested during practice. A lifeguard sitting in a chair cannot perform a swim test.</li>
                    <li>After passing the swim test each child will be given a wristband to wear while they are at the
                        pool – blue or yellow for members, orange for non-members.</li>
                    <li>All those passing will be recorded in a log for future reference.</li>
