                Swim Testing Policy
                To assess ability and safety for swimming independently in the pool, SOC Pool requires that anyone 10 years of age and younger pass a swim test. This policy applies to members and guests.
                The test consists of a 25-yard swim (without touching the wall) and 1-minute treading water in the deep end. 
                Tests will take place at rest periods or anytime a guard is free. Swim team members may be tested during practice. A lifeguard sitting in a chair cannot perform a swim test. 
                After passing the swim test each child will be given a wristband to wear while they are at the pool â€“ blue or yellow for members, orange for non-members. 
                All those passing will be recorded in a log for future reference. 
                Those who do not pass are welcome to try again in the future. They must have a responsible adult swimmer directly supervise them in the pool until they can pass the swim test. 
                Lost wrist bands will be replaced during the summer for a $1. 
                Parents unsure of abilities of older children may request testing.
